Subject: eSim Semester Long Internship Spring 2026 Submission Task 6 - Plugin Proposal

Dear eSim Team,

I am writing to submit my proposal for Task 6: KiCad Plugin Development.

**Plugin Name:** SpiralGen Pro - Advanced Planar Inductor Generator

**Concept:**
SpiralGen Pro is an advanced KiCad 9 PCB Editor plugin that automates the design of planar spiral inductors. It goes beyond simple drawing by integrating physics-based inductance estimation and multi-geometry support, demonstrating a strong fusion of Computer Science algorithms and RF Electronics principles.

**Functionality:**
- **Multi-Geometry Support:** Generates Circular, Square, and Octagonal spirals using parametric geometric algorithms.
- **Physics-Integrated Design:** Provides real-time estimation of inductance (in nH) using Mohan’s Data Dependent Expressions as parameters are adjusted.
- **Automated Connectivity:** detailed control over track width/spacing and optional automatic center-via stitching for layer interconnection.
- **User Interface:** A robust wxPython-based GUI for seamless interaction within KiCad.

**Integration of Fields:**
- **Computer Science:** Implementation of geometric generation algorithms and object-oriented architecture.
- **Electronics:** Application of RF circuit design formulas (Mohan's approximations) and PCB layout automation.

**Status:**
I have already developed a working prototype demonstrating all the above features. The Design Document and Source Code are available for your review.

**Repository Link:** [Insert Your GitHub Link Here]
**Design Document:** [Link to your design_document.md in the repo]

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[My Name]
